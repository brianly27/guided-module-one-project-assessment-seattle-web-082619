# tomorrow's goals:
# release pokemon
# delete user?
# throw pokeball with 50% catch rate
# pokemon attempts to run after every turn with 25% success rate

# then:
# pokemon are able to attack
# being hit by an attack ends the battle
# the defending pokemon can attempt to dodge with 50% chance of success
