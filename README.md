Module One Final Project - Pokemon CLI
========================

Congratulations, you're at the end of module one! You've worked crazy hard to get here and have learned a ton.

This is the first command line app I have designed and created. Users can log in and catch pokemon. Users can interact with their pokemon in various ways CRUD data in the database:
  - users can log in again and view their saved pokemon (READ)
  - catching a pokemon (CREATE)
  - giving your pokemon a nickname (UPDATE)
  - releasing your pokemon into the wild (DELETE)
  - work out with your pokemon
